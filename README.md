Live Webcam ASCII Converter

Overview
The Live Webcam ASCII Converter is a web-based application that transforms live webcam video feed into ASCII art in real-time. It captures video from your webcam, processes each frame, and converts it into ASCII characters, displaying the result alongside the original video feed. The project offers customizable settings such as character sets, resolution, and color inversion, making it a fun and interactive way to explore ASCII art generation.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging the WebRTC API for webcam access and the HTML5 Canvas API for image processing. It is designed to be lightweight, responsive, and user-friendly, with a retro terminal aesthetic.

Features
Real-Time ASCII Conversion: Converts live webcam video into ASCII art with minimal latency.
Customizable Settings:
Character Sets: Choose from three character sets for ASCII rendering: Standard (@#S%?*+;:,.), Blocks (█▓▒░), and Simple (#. ).
Resolution: Adjust the resolution (number of columns) using a slider (20 to 200 columns).
Invert Colors: Toggle color inversion to switch between light and dark ASCII representations.
Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
Error Handling: Displays user-friendly error messages if webcam access fails (e.g., permission denied or camera not found).
Performance Optimization: Includes frame-skipping to improve performance on slower devices.
Demo
You can try a live demo of the project  (replace with an actual demo link if hosted online). Alternatively, follow the setup instructions below to run it locally.

Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:

A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) that supports the WebRTC and Canvas APIs.
A webcam connected to your device.
A local development server (optional but recommended for testing due to browser security restrictions on webcam access).
Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

Clone or Download the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git, or download the ZIP file and extract it:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/live-webcam-ascii-converter.git
Replace your-username with your GitHub username if you host the project on GitHub.
Navigate to the Project Directory
Change into the project directory:
bash

Collapse

Copy
cd live-webcam-ascii-converter
Project Structure
Ensure the following files are present in your project directory:

├── styles.css       # CSS styles for the application
├── script.js        # JavaScript logic for webcam access and ASCII conversion
└── README.md        # This README file
Set Up a Local Server (Recommended)
Due to browser security restrictions, webcam access (getUserMedia) typically requires a secure context (HTTPS or localhost). Use a local development server to serve the files:
If you have Node.js installed, you can use http-server:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
npm install -g http-server
http-server .
Alternatively, use Python's built-in server (Python 3):
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
python -m http.server 8000
Or, if you're using VS Code, use the "Live Server" extension to serve the files.
Open the Application
Open your browser and navigate to the local server URL (e.g., http://localhost:8000). You should see the "Live Webcam ASCII Converter" interface.
Grant Webcam Permission
When prompted, allow the browser to access your webcam. The application will start converting the video feed into ASCII art.
